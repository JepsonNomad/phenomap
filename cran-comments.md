## Note:

* This submission is a package update to accommodate the shift from rgdal/raster to sf/terra. Vector operations are not included so terra is the only spatial library required for the new version; dplyr is no longer imported either because it is now unnecessary for phenomap operations.


## Test environments

* OS X Monterey v.12.3.1, R 4.1.0
* Windows 7 (x64), R 3.4.2


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes
